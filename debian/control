Description: A completely safe version of rm for Athena
 saferm is a file removal program which can be used running as root
 to safely remove, and optionally zero, files or directories from
 world-writable directories, such as /tmp.  It will refuse to
 change directories through symbolic links, and it will not zero
 files that have more than one hard link.
