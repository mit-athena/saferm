.SH DESCRIPTION
.I saferm
is a file removal program which can be used running as root to safely
remove and optionally zero files or directories from world-writable
directories, such as /tmp.  It will refuse to change directories
through symbolic links, and it will not zero files that have more than
one hard link.  Files are zeroed only when the
.B \-z
option is specified.  If a directory is being removed, the
.B \-d
flag must be specified.  The
.B \-q
flag suppresses the error message for the case when a directory
cannot be removed because it is not empty.
